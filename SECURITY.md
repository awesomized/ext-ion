## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please refrain from creating a 
public issue on Github, but rather contact me directly at <mike@php.net> 
or [another suitable private contact method](https://m6w6.name/#contact).

Any past vulnerabilities should be found in release changelogs after they 
have been fixed.

This is free and open source software provided under the the terms of

Thus, honor and goodwill is all being offered for reporting 
-- or even fixing -- any vulnerability.
